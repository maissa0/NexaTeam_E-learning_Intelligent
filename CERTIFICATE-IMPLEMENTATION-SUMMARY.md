# Certificate Management Functionality Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the certificate management functionality implementation.

## Overview

The certificate management functionality allows users to upload, view, download, update, and delete certificates. The system supports any file type, not just image files, and logs all certificate operations for audit purposes.

## Components

### 1. Entity Classes

#### Certificate Entity
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `title`: The title of the certificate (original filename)
- `fromWhere`: Where the certificate is from (e.g., "University", "Training Center")
- `fileType`: The MIME type of the file
- `data`: The binary data of the file (stored as BLOB)
- `user`: The user who owns the certificate (Many-to-One relationship)

#### AuditLog Entity
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `action`: The action performed (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `username`: The username of the user who performed the action
- `certificationId`: The ID of the certificate
- `certificationName`: The name of the certificate
- `timestamp`: When the action was performed

### 2. Repositories

#### CertificateRepository
- Extends `JpaRepository<Certificate, String>`
- Methods:
  - `findByUserUserId(Long userId)`: Find certificates by user ID
  - `findByUserUserName(String username)`: Find certificates by username

#### AuditLogRepository
- Extends `JpaRepository<AuditLog, Long>`
- Methods:
  - `findByCertificationId(String certificationId)`: Find audit logs by certificate ID

### 3. Services

#### CertificateService Interface
- Methods:
  - `saveCertificate(MultipartFile file, String username, String fromWhere)`: Save a certificate
  - `getCertificate(String fileId)`: Get a certificate by ID
  - `getCertificatesForUser(String username)`: Get certificates for a user by username
  - `getCertificatesForUser(Long userId)`: Get certificates for a user by user ID
  - `deleteCertificate(String fileId, String username)`: Delete a certificate
  - `updateCertificateInfo(String fileId, String fromWhere, String username)`: Update certificate information

#### CertificateServiceImpl
- Implements `CertificateService`
- Dependencies:
  - `CertificateRepository`
  - `UserRepository`
  - `AuditLogService`
- Implementation details:
  - Validates user existence
  - Handles file storage in the database
  - Performs security checks (e.g., ensuring a user can only access their own certificates)
  - Logs all operations using the `AuditLogService`

#### AuditLogService Interface
- Methods:
  - `logCertCreation(String username, Certificate cert)`: Log certificate creation
  - `logCertUpdate(String username, Certificate cert)`: Log certificate update
  - `logCertDeletion(String username, String certId)`: Log certificate deletion
  - `getAllAuditLogs()`: Get all audit logs
  - `getAuditLogsForCertificationId(String id)`: Get audit logs for a certificate

#### AuditLogServiceImpl
- Implements `AuditLogService`
- Dependencies:
  - `AuditLogRepository`
- Implementation details:
  - Creates and saves audit log entries for certificate operations

### 4. Controllers

#### CertificateController
- Base path: `/api/certs`
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /upload`: Upload a certificate
  - `GET /`: Get all certificates for the authenticated user
  - `GET /{fileId}`: Get a certificate by ID
  - `GET /download/{fileId}`: Download a certificate
  - `PUT /{fileId}`: Update certificate information
  - `DELETE /{fileId}`: Delete a certificate
- Dependencies:
  - `CertificateService`
- Implementation details:
  - Handles HTTP requests and responses
  - Uses `@AuthenticationPrincipal UserDetails` to get the authenticated user
  - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and response bodies

#### AuditLogController
- Base path: `/api/audit`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /`: Get all audit logs
  - `GET /cert/{id}`: Get audit logs for a certificate
- Dependencies:
  - `AuditLogService`
- Implementation details:
  - Handles HTTP requests and responses
  - Returns audit log data

### 5. Response Classes

#### CertResponse
- Fields:
  - `fileName`: The name of the file
  - `downloadURL`: The URL to download the file
  - `fileType`: The MIME type of the file
  - `fileSize`: The size of the file in bytes
- Used to return certificate information in a standardized format

#### MessageResponse
- Fields:
  - `message`: A message to the client
- Used to return success or error messages

## Security

- All certificate endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access, update, and delete their own certificates
- All certificate operations are logged for audit purposes

## Testing

Detailed testing instructions are provided in the `README-CERTIFICATE.md` file, including:
- How to test with Postman
- How to test with cURL
- Error scenarios and how to handle them

## Configuration

- Maximum file size: 200MB (configurable in `application.properties`)
- Supported file types: Any file type

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the certificate management functionality:
1. Add pagination for the list of certificates
2. Add filtering and sorting options
3. Add the ability to share certificates with other users
4. Add the ability to categorize certificates
5. Add the ability to add notes or comments to certificates
6. Add the ability to verify certificates with issuers
7. Add the ability to export certificates to PDF or other formats
